# OOP-with-C-Sharp
## Class:

Definition: A blueprint for creating objects. It defines a data structure along with methods to operate on that data.
## Object:

Definition: An instance of a class. Objects are created based on the structure defined by a class and can interact with each other.
##Encapsulation:

Definition: Encapsulation is the bundling of data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit, known as a class.
Purpose: It helps in hiding the internal implementation details and exposing only what is necessary.
## Inheritance:

Definition: Inheritance allows a new class (subclass/derived class) to inherit properties and behaviors from an existing class (superclass/base class).
Purpose: It promotes code reuse and establishes a relationship between classes, where common features are defined in a superclass.
## Polymorphism:

Definition: Polymorphism allows objects of different types to be treated as objects of a common type.
Compile-time Polymorphism: Achieved through method overloading.
Runtime Polymorphism: Achieved through method overriding.
Purpose: It supports flexibility and extensibility in code, allowing a single interface to represent different types of objects.
## Abstraction:

Definition: Abstraction involves simplifying complex systems by modeling classes based on their essential properties and behaviors.
Purpose: It hides the irrelevant details and exposes only what is necessary for the outside world to interact with, making the code more modular and easy to understand.
